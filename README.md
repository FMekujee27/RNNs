Recurrent neural network (RNN) has made breakthroughs in time series forecasting. The goal of this project is to see which model performs the best for the
crude oil price prediction. In this research, the lag closing price and opening
price are used to calculate closing price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI). The
sentiment score is also included for the price prediction as sentiment analysis
has shown potential for finding trends. RNN models with different architecture like Simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM), Gated Recurrent Network (GRU), ESN (Echo State Network) and
Quasi Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) were compared based on different accuracy matrices and time.
